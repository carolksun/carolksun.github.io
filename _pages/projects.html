					<h4>Filtering Cost Effective Ad Requests Using Early Delivery Stack Features</h4>
					<p>Summer 2019, OpenX</p>
				</header>
				<p>Using gateway features from ad requests, I implemented and tuned machine learning models, such as logistic regression, neural networks, and boosted trees. The prototype model provided proof of concept to preserve 99% of the revenue while removing over 6% of the total ad requests, enabling the company to save over $100,000 per year. </p>

					<h4>Adjusting Protein Levels for Genotype to Improve the Accuracy of Multiple Sclerosis Diagnostic Tests</h4>
					<p>Summer 2017-2018, National Institutes of Health</p>
				</header>
				<p>In the summer of 2017, I was a full-time summer intern in the Neuroimmunological Diseases Unit at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke under the supervision of Dr. Bielekova. My project improved a Multiple Sclerosis molecular diagnostic test through R (a statistical programming language) and PLINK (a genome data analysis toolset) by adjusting the protein levels based on genotype. I curated genotype data related to eQTLs (expression quantitative trait loci) for over 400 individuals and ran simulations to determine the effect of standard deviation, sample size, and minor allele frequency on the power of the approach. In August, I presented at the NIH Summer Poster Day and won Honorable Mention.</p>
				<p>Throughout senior year, I worked as a volunteer for the lab, applying my methods from the last summer to optimize a random-forest model that predicted the rate of progression for Multiple Sclerosis. The summer after senior year, 2018, I returned to the NIH, performing the adjustments for genotype and performing my own machine-learned models. After running the patient data and simulations, we improved the accuracy of the model by 3%. In August, I again presented at the Summer Poster Day and won Honorable Mention.</p>
